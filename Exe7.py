# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.


__author__ = 'racattaque'

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
even_a = [x for x in a if x%2==0]
print(even_a)
